### **4. Traefik: Per-connection backend transport leak from unauthenticated Negotiate/NTLM headers (3.7.14+)**

**GHSA-xv5x-242w-7hf7** (no CVE yet) | Disclosed: November 2, 2026

**Project** : Traefik

**Technical Details** : Traefik contains a high severity vulnerability in its NTLM and Kerberos backend connection handling affecting versions 2.11.58 through 2.11.60 and versions 3.7.14 through 3.7.16. Unauthenticated clients can exploit this flaw by opening many short-lived connections containing specific Authorization headers, causing Traefik to leak backend transports, idle connections, and goroutines that are not released when the client connection closes. This resource leak allows an attacker to exhaust the memory, file descriptors, and backend connections of the Traefik process regardless of whether NTLM or Kerberos backends are configured.

* **Severity** : High (CVSS 7.5)
* **Affected** : github.com/traefik/traefik/v2 &gt;= v2.11.58, &lt;= v2.11.60; github.com/traefik/traefik/v3 &gt;= v3.7.14, &lt;= v3.7.16
* **Fixed** : v2.11.61, v3.7.17
* **Workaround** : None documented.

### **5. Caddy: Host and :authority values with dot segments or slashes escape a {host}-based root**

**GHSA-r766-rf9f-588h** (no CVE yet) | Disclosed: November 4, 2026

**Project** : Caddy

**Technical Details** : Sites using a root path based on the request host allow clients to choose the document root because HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 servers insufficiently validate the `:authority` header, accepting characters like dot segments, slashes, and backslashes. An attacker can exploit this flaw to move the document root anywhere on the filesystem, allowing the fileserver to serve files and phpfastcgi to run PHP files outside the intended tree. This vulnerability affects Caddy versions up to 2.11.7.

* **Severity** : High
* **Affected** : github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2 &lt;= 2.11.7
* **Fixed** : 2.11.8
* **Workaround** : None documented.

Operators can audit imported instances for non-regular files, hard links or symlinks in the metadata area (everything in the instance volume except the rootfs…
3. Review recent logs of the affected service for unusual requests before and after patching.
4. Verify: after the restart, confirm the running version is v7.6.0 or later and the service passes its health check.
